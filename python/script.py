# #Sequence prefixes lookup
#
# This approach is described in Neil Sloane's book [Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences](http://neilsloane.com/doc/EIStext.pdf) (chapter 2.5: analysis of differences).
#
# Suppose we have a sequence `[ 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216 ]` and want to predict next term. This sequence is cubes: $ f(n)=n^3 $.
#
# An array of differences is `[ 8 - 1, 27 - 8, 64 - 27, 125 - 64, 216 - 125 ] = [ 7, 19, 37, 61, 91 ]`. A simple quick look at this sequence doesn't let us recognize it. We'll define it as $ f_1( n ) = f_0( n + 1 ) - f_0( n ) $ where $ f_0( n ) = f( n ) $ is the original sequence. If we calculate differences once again, we get: `[ 19 - 7, 37 - 19, 61 - 37, 91 - 61 ] = [ 12, 18, 24, 30 ]`. And this pattern is already recognizable. Let's take one more: `[ 18 - 12, 24 - 18, 30 - 24 ] = [ 6, 6, 6 ]`. A constant value of `6`. How to get a next element? We need to add one more constant `6` to the array of third differences. Then the next element of second differences $ f_2( n ) = f_2( n - 1 ) + f_3( n - 1 ) $. So, $ f_2( 5 ) = f_2( 4 ) + f_3( 4 ) = 30 + 6 = 36 $. Analogously, $ f_1( 6 ) = f_1( 5 ) + f_2( 5 ) = 91 + 36 = 127 $. Finally, $ f_0( 7 ) = f_0( 6 ) + f_1( 6 ) = 216 + 127 = 343 $. Check: $ f( 7 ) = 7^3 = 343 = f_0( 7 ) $ â€“ correct.
#
# Another example: `[ 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 ]`. Differences: `[ 2 - 1, 4 - 2, 8 - 4, 16 - 8, 32 - 16, 64 - 32 ] = [ 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 ]`. The result is the original sequence itself. We can take the next element from the first array: `64`. Then the next element of original sequence is $ f_0( 8 ) = f_0( 7 ) + f_1( 7 ) = 64 + 64 = 128 $.
#
# In many cases a next item of sequence can be predicted by calculating a next item of differences array. And if that array is recognizable then we are able to easily find the next item. It's possible to recognize an array by looking it up in a prefix tree (trie).
#
# That trie would contain not sequences themselves but their signatures. We'll use a definition of signature function suggested by [Nina Chen](https://www.kaggle.com/ncchen) in [this article](https://www.kaggle.com/ncchen/integer-sequence-learning/match-test-set-to-training-set) with a slight change: $$ signature( seq ) = sign( seq ) \star \frac{ seq }{ GCD( seq ) } $$.
#
# Here, `sign` is a sign of the first non-zero item of sequence `seq` (+1 if the item is positive, or -1 otherwise) and `GCD` is a greatest common divisor of all sequence elements.
#
# Example: sequence `[ 2, 4, 6, 8 ]` would be stored in a trie as `[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]` because `GCD( [ 2, 4, 6, 8 ] ) = 2` and we divide each element of sequence by GCD.

# Also, note that we add an extra sequence with ID = 0 consisting of 400 ones (`[ 1, 1, 1, ..., 1 ]`). Any polynomial sequence would be collapsed to constants array by taking differences recursively. The signature of constants array is `[ 1, 1, ..., 1 ]`. The sequence with ID = 0 would help us to deal with it. It would easily return 1 as a next element prediction.

# This code adds a signature of each sequence to a trie. Also, it shifts a sequence (removing first items) and adds a signature of a shifted sequence too. Look at the Fibonacci sequence differences: `[ 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 ] -> [ 1 - 1, 2 - 1, 3 - 2, 5 - 3, 8 - 5, 13 - 8, 21 - 13 ] = [ 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 ]`. We get the original sequence itself but shifted right by a new zero item.
#
# So, we need to store the same sequences with additional shifts up to 4 elements to let searching for shifted sequences.
#
# And we store differences arrays up to order 4.
#
# Each stored sequence maps to a weight. This weight is calculated as a percent of length comparing to the original length of a sequence. When we try to find a next element for a sequence `[ 2, 3, 6 ]`, we get an array of two elements. Then we sort it by weight, so shifted sequences would have less priority than original sequences. An array `[ 2, 3, 6 ]` has two candidate sequences with the same 100 % weight. It means that such a short sequence is not enough to precisely predict a next element. We'll choose an element from a longest sequence.

# Let's define a function that finds best candidate sequence and retrieves a next element from it:

#
# Here's a function that calls `findNext` for the original sequence. If a next element cannot be predicted then a differences array is calculated and prediction is performed for it.
